# Workstation Admin

This is the repo where we manage all the admin scripts that the student
computers use. This includes:

* system restore scripts
* persistent machine-specific settings
* nightly app settings resets
* nightly repo fetches
* ad-hoc scripts (e.g. force-refresh Github tabs)

## Local Computer Data

We use the recovery partition to save some basic computer data such as
`id`, `pod`, and `station` so that it will persist between restores.
This data is used to set the device hostname and to keep track of
settings for some scripts.

### Settings script

To set this data, use the `./settings` script. This requires sudo. For
example:

```sh
sudo ./settings set id=15 pod=SoMa station=3
```

You can also remove a key by leaving the value blank:

```sh
sudo ./settings set id=3 pod= station=
```

There's another important feature: `set-local`. This allows you to set
data locally only. That way it will not persist after the computer
resets. Typically this is done when giving a computer to a job search
student:

```sh
sudo ./settings set-local student="Jane Doe" reset-data=false
```

### Specific meanings.

You'll need to update this data to stay in sync with these requirements:

|     key      |     meaning    |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| `id`         | ID # stuck on top of the machine. Every machine should have this set. |
| `pod`        | only set for machines that are on the floor |
| `station`    | # in the pod. Only set for floor machines |
| `student`    | name of student this computer is loaned to (only set if it is loaned) |
| `reset-data` | reset the desktop and app data every night (true/false) |

## Setup

You should only need to do this when creating a new disk image. You
**must** complete all the previous steps from the [workstation image
spec][workstation-image-spec] or `workstation-admin` will cache an old
version of the settings and overwrite your changes in the first night.

### Hack Chrome.

One final setting must be attended to before we cache.

Chrome will always prompt the user to signin on startup. We don't want
this. We want it to just display a new tab. Unfortunately, there's
no configuration for this, but you can hack it.

Make sure you quit (âŒ˜Q) Chrome before running this script.

```
setup/disable_chrome_signin_prompt
```

### Clear Browsing data.

Chrome: Clear all browsing data from "the beginning of time".

### Cache the settings.

```
setup/cache_app_data
```

### Install the hooks.

This will install all the necessary hooks for the admin scripts to run.

```
setup/install
```
